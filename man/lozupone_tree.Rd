\title{Example data for UniFrac distance}
\format{\code{lozupone_tree} is a phylogenetic tree with 14 tips, labeled
A-N. It was created with the \code{ape} library.

The data frames \code{lozupone_panel_a} and \code{lozupone_panel_b} are
transcribed from Figure 1 of the paper. They have the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{Species}{The species label, matching to the phylogenetic tree.}
  \item{SampleID}{The community, either "Circle" or "Square".}
  \item{Counts}{
    The number of organisms counted per species, always 1 for this
    example.}
