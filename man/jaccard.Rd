\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Numeric vectors}
}
\value{
The dissimilarity between \code{x} and \code{y}, based on
  presence/absence. The Jaccard, Sorenson, Sokal-Sneath, Yule, and both
  Kulczynski dissimilarities are not defined if both \code{x} and \code{y}
  have no nonzero elements. In addition, the second Kulczynski index and the
  Yule index of dissimilarity are not defined if one of the vectors has no
  nonzero elements. We return \code{NaN} for undefined values.
}
\description{
These functions transform the input vectors to binary or presence/absence
format, then compute a distance or dissimilarity.
}
\details{
Many of these indices are covered in Koleff et al. (2003), so we adopt their
notation. For two vectors \code{x} and \code{y}, we define three quantities:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{a} is the number of species that are present in both \code{x}
    and \code{y},
  \item \eqn{b} is the number of species that are present in \code{y} but
    not \code{x},
  \item \eqn{c} is the number of species that are present in \code{x} but
    not \code{y}, and
  \item \eqn{d} is the number of species absent in both vectors.
}
The quantity \eqn{d} is seldom used in ecology, for good reason. For
details, please see the discussion on the "double zero problem," in section
2 of chapter 7.2 in Legendre & Legendre.

The \emph{Jaccard} index of dissimilarity is \eqn{1 - a / (a + b + c)}, or
one minus the proportion of shared species, counting over both samples
together. Relation of \code{jaccard()} to other definitions:
\itemize{
  \item Equivalent to R's built-in \code{dist()} function with
    \code{method = "binary"}.
  \item Equivalent to \code{vegdist()} with \code{method = "jaccard"}
    and \code{binary = TRUE}.
  \item Equivalent to the \code{jaccard()} function in
    \code{scipy.spatial.distance}, except that we always convert vectors to
    presence/absence.
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - S_7} in Legendre & Legendre.
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - \beta_j}, as well as \eqn{\beta_{cc}}, and
    \eqn{\beta_g} in Koleff (2003).
}

The \emph{\enc{SÃ¸renson}{Sorenson}} or \emph{Dice} index of dissimilarity is
\eqn{1 - 2a / (2a + b + c)}, or one minus the average proportion of shared
species, counting over each sample individually. Relation of
\code{sorenson()} to other definitions:
\itemize{
  \item Equivalent to the \code{dice()} function in
    \code{scipy.spatial.distance}, except that we always convert vectors to
    presence/absence.
  \item Equivalent to the \code{sorclass} calculator in Mothur, and to
    \code{1 - whittaker}.
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{D_{13} = 1 - S_8}{D_13 = 1 - S_8} in Legendre &
    Legendre.
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - \beta_{sor}} in Koleff (2003). Also
    equivalent to Whittaker's beta diversity
    (the second definition, \eqn{\beta_w = (S / \bar{a}) - 1}), as well as
    \eqn{\beta_{-1}}, \eqn{\beta_t}, \eqn{\beta_{me}}, and
    \eqn{\beta_{hk}}.

I have not been able to track down the original reference for the first and
second Kulczynski indices, but we have good formulas from Legendre &
Legendre. The \emph{first Kulczynski index} is \eqn{1 - a / (b + c)}, or
one minus the ratio of shared to unshared species.

Relation of \code{kulczynski_first} to other definitions:
\itemize{
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - S_{12}}{1 - S_12} in Legendre & Legendre.
  \item Equivalent to the \code{kulczynski} calculator in Mothur.
}

Some people refer to the \emph{second Kulczynski index} as the
Kulczynski-Cody index. It is defined as one minus the average proportion of
shared species in each vector,
\deqn{
  d = 1 - \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{a}{a + b} + \frac{a}{a + c} \right ).
}
Relation of \code{kulczynski_second} to other definitions:
\itemize{
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - S_{13}}{1 - S_13} in Legendre & Legendre.
  \item Equivalent to the \code{kulczynskicody} calculator in Mothur.
  \item Equivalent to one minus the Kulczynski similarity in Hayek (1994).
  \item Equivalent to \code{vegdist()} with \code{method = "kulczynski"} and
    \code{binary = TRUE}.
}

The \emph{Rogers-Tanimoto} distance is defined as
\eqn{(2b + 2c) / (a + 2b + 2c + d)}. Relation of \code{rogers_tanimoto()}
to other definitions:
\itemize{
  \item Equivalent to the \code{rogerstanimoto()} function in
    \code{scipy.spatial.distance}, except that we always convert vectors to
    presence/absence.
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - S_2}{1 - S_2} in Legendre & Legendre.
}

The \emph{Russel-Rao} distance is defined
\eqn{(b + c + d) / (a + b + c + d)}, or the fraction of elements not present
in both vectors, counting double absences. Relation of \code{russel_rao()} to
other definitions:
\itemize{
  \item Equivalent to the \code{russelrao()} function in
    \code{scipy.spatial.distance}, except that we always convert vectors to
    presence/absence.
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - S_{11}}{1 - S_11} in Legendre & Legendre.
}

The \emph{Sokal-Michener} distance is defined as

    \code{scipy.spatial.distance}, except that we always convert vectors to
    presence/absence.
}

The \emph{Sokal-Sneath} distance is defined as
\eqn{(2b + 2c) / (a + 2b + 2c)}. Relation of \code{sokal_sneath()} to other

    presence/absence.

The \emph{Yule} dissimilarity is defined as \eqn{2bc / (ad + bc)}. Relation
of \code{yule_dissimilarity()} to other definitions:

    presence/absence.
  \item Equivalent to \eqn{1 - S}, where \eqn{S} is the Yule coefficient
    in Legendre & Legendre.
