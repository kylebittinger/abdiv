Title: Alpha and beta diversity measures
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Kyle Bittinger
Maintainer: Kyle Bittinger <kylebittinger@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides a collection of measures for ecological
  diversity.
  Ecological diversity comes in two flavors: alpha diversity measures
  the diversity within a single site or sample, and beta diversity measures
  the diversity across two sites or samples.
  This package overlaps cosiderably with other packages such as
  vegan, gUniFrac, betapart, and fossil. The implementations here are designed
  to be basic and clear to the reader.
  We include a wide range of functions implemented in software outside the R
  ecosystem, such as scipy and scikit-bio.
