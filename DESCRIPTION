Description: This package contains a collection of basic functions for
    community ecology, and overlaps cosiderably with other packages such as
    vegan and fossil. The implementation here is designed to work well with
    "tidy" data sets and to include a wide range of functions implemented in 
    software outside the R ecosystem.
