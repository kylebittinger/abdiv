Description: A collection of measures for measuring ecological diversity.
  Ecological diversity comes in two flavors: alpha diversity measures the
  diversity within a single site or sample, and beta diversity measures the
  diversity across two sites or samples. This package overlaps considerably
  with other R packages such as 'vegan', 'gUniFrac', 'betapart', and 'fossil'.
  We also include a wide range of functions that are implemented in software
  outside the R ecosystem, such as 'scipy', 'Mothur', and 'scikit-bio'.  The
  implementations here are designed to be basic and clear to the reader.
