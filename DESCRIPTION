Title: Alpha and Beta Diversity Measures
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Kyle Bittinger
Maintainer: Kyle Bittinger <kylebittinger@gmail.com>
Description: A collection of measures for measuring ecological diversity.
  Ecological diversity comes in two flavors: alpha diversity measures the
  diversity within a single site or sample, and beta diversity measures the
  diversity across two sites or samples. This package overlaps considerably
  with other packages such as vegan, gUniFrac, betapart, and fossil. The
  implementations here are designed to be basic and clear to the reader. We
  include a wide range of functions implemented in software outside the R
  ecosystem, such as scipy, Mothur, and scikit-bio.
